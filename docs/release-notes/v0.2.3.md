# Version 0.2.3

**Release Date:** November 3, 2025

This release adds support for database naming conventions, enabling automatic application of naming patterns like snake_case to entity mappings.

---

## New Features

### Naming Convention Support

Added support for Entity Framework Core naming conventions, allowing developers to apply consistent naming patterns across their database schema without manual configuration for each property.

This feature enables the use of common database naming conventions such as:

- `snake_case` - Converts `PropertyName` to `property_name`
- `kebab-case` - Converts `PropertyName` to `property-name`
- Custom naming patterns defined through EF Core's naming convention API

With this feature, the library now respects naming conventions configured at the model level, reducing boilerplate configuration and ensuring consistency across TimescaleDB-specific features like hypertables, continuous aggregates, and reorder policies.

## Dependencies

This release maintains compatibility with Entity Framework Core and PostgreSQL provider dependencies from previous versions.
