# Version 0.2.1

**Release Date:** October 31, 2025

This release adds support for additional Entity Framework Core database management methods when working with TimescaleDB.

---

## New Features

### Enhanced Database Management Support

Implemented a custom `DbMigrationsSqlGenerator` to support additional Entity Framework Core database management methods that were previously unavailable when using TimescaleDB.

This enhancement enables developers to use methods such as:

- `Database.EnsureCreatedAsync()` - Asynchronously creates the database and schema
- `Database.EnsureCreated()` - Synchronously creates the database and schema

**Example Usage:**

```csharp
await using var context = new ApplicationDbContext();

// Now supported with TimescaleDB
await context.Database.EnsureCreatedAsync();

// TimescaleDB-specific features are properly initialized
```

Previously, these methods would not properly initialize TimescaleDB-specific features like hypertables and continuous aggregates. The custom SQL generator ensures that all TimescaleDB operations are included when using these convenience methods.
