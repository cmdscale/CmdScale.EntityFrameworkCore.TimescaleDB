# Version 0.3.3

**Release Date:** November 27, 2025

This release adds support for Apache and Community editions of TimescaleDB, ensuring compatibility across different TimescaleDB licensing models.

---

## New Features

### TimescaleDB Edition Support

The hypertable migration generator now includes runtime license checking to properly handle features specific to the TimescaleDB Community edition. The generator automatically wraps Community-only features with appropriate conditional logic based on the detected TimescaleDB edition.

This enhancement ensures that migrations work correctly regardless of whether the database uses the Apache Edition or Community Edition of TimescaleDB.

## Improvements

### Enhanced SQL Generation for Hypertables

The migration generator has been updated to use `EXECUTE` statements within `DO $$` blocks when configuring hypertables. This approach resolves PL/pgSQL limitations where SELECT statements cannot return data without a destination.

Key improvements include:

- Proper escaping of single quotes for EXECUTE string literals
- Relocated `chunk_time_interval` parameter directly into `create_hypertable()` function calls for cleaner SQL generation
- Version-aware checks that account for different TimescaleDB editions during migration generation
- Updated warning messages to reference Apache Edition compatibility where applicable

---

## Dependencies

This release maintains compatibility with Entity Framework Core and PostgreSQL provider dependencies from previous versions.
