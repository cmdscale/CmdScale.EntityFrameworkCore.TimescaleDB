**Release Date:** November 17, 2025

This release resolves an issue where modifications to hypertable dimensions were not being detected during migrations.

## Bug Fixes

### Hypertable Dimension Alterations

Fixed a critical issue where changes to hypertable dimensions were not detected during Entity Framework Core migrations. Previously, adding or removing dimensions from an existing hypertable would not generate the appropriate migration operations.

The fix introduces dimension comparison logic that tracks changes to:

- Column name
- Dimension type (space or time)
- Interval configuration
- Number of partitions

When dimensions are modified, the migration generator now:

- Creates SQL statements for newly added dimensions in the `Up()` method
- Includes warning comments for removed dimensions in the `Down()` method

**Note:** TimescaleDB does not support removing dimensions from existing hypertables. The migration generator includes comments in the down migration to document this limitation.

The migration system now properly detects these changes and generates the corresponding SQL operations.

## Dependencies

This release maintains compatibility with Entity Framework Core and PostgreSQL provider dependencies from previous versions.
