# Version 0.2.0

**Release Date:** September 24, 2025

This release introduces support for TimescaleDB reorder policies, enabling automatic data reorganization for improved query performance.

---

## New Features

### Reorder Policies for Hypertables

Added comprehensive support for TimescaleDB reorder policies, which automatically reorganize chunk data based on specified indexes to optimize query performance across large time ranges.

Reorder policies can be configured using either data annotations or the fluent API, with control over:

- **Schedule Interval** - How frequently the reorder policy runs
- **Maximum Runtime** - Upper limit on policy execution time
- **Maximum Retries** - Number of retry attempts on failure
- **Retry Period** - Delay between retry attempts

Reorder policies work by physically reorganizing data within chunks according to the specified index, significantly improving query performance when filtering by indexed columns.

## Improvements

### Performance Benchmarking

Established performance baselines by comparing the library's `BulkCopyAsync` helper method against direct Npgsql binary copy operations. This benchmark framework enables ongoing performance monitoring and optimization.

---

## Dependencies

This release maintains compatibility with Entity Framework Core and PostgreSQL provider dependencies from previous versions.
