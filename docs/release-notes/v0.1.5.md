Configure the DbContext:

```csharp
protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    optionsBuilder.UseNpgsql(connectionString)
        .UseTimescaleDb();
}
```

Define a hypertable:

```csharp
[Hypertable]
public class SensorReading
{
    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }
    public double Temperature { get; set; }
}
```
