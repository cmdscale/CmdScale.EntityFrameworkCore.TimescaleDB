## Bug Fixes

### Hypertable Creation Schema Validation

Resolved a critical issue where hypertables were not being created due to incorrect schema validation logic. The bug occurred when the schema checking mechanism failed to properly validate schema configurations, preventing the hypertable creation process from executing.

This fix ensures that hypertables are created correctly regardless of the schema configuration in the database context.
