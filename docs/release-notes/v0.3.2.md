# Version 0.3.2

**Release Date:** November 26, 2025

This release introduces support for controlling data migration when converting tables to hypertables and resolves a critical migration ordering issue.

---

## New Features

### Migrate Data Parameter Support

Added the ability to control whether existing data should be migrated when converting a PostgreSQL table to a TimescaleDB hypertable. This feature provides flexibility when working with tables that already contain data.

The `migrate_data` parameter can be configured using either data annotations or the fluent API:

When set to `true`, the migration generator includes `migrate_data => true` in the SQL parameters passed to TimescaleDB's `create_hypertable()` function.

---

## Bug Fixes

### Migration Operation Ordering

Resolved an issue where migration operations could execute in the wrong order, causing migrations to fail. The problem occurred when `CreateIndex` operations appeared before their corresponding `CreateTable` operations.

The fix replaces `List.Sort()` with `OrderBy()` to ensure stable sorting that preserves the correct dependency order between operations. This ensures generated migrations execute successfully without manual intervention.

### Empty Migration Builder Statements

Added a safety check in `TimescaleCSharpMigrationOperationGenerator` to prevent the generation of empty migration builder statements that could cause syntax errors in generated migration files.

## Improvements

### Project Structure Reorganization

The repository structure has been reorganized for improved maintainability:

- Code is now organized into `src/`, `tests/`, `samples/`, and `benchmarks/` directories
- Project folders renamed to follow the `Eftdb.*` convention while preserving namespace backward compatibility
- Build workflows and reference scripts updated accordingly

This reorganization does not affect the public API or require changes to existing code.

### Development Environment

Added VSCode configuration files to provide better formatting and spell-checking settings for contributors.

---

## Dependencies

This release maintains compatibility with Entity Framework Core and PostgreSQL provider dependencies from previous versions.
