# Version 0.2.2

**Release Date:** November 3, 2025

This release adds support for custom database schemas in TimescaleDB operations.

---

## New Features

### Custom Schema Support

Added comprehensive support for custom database schemas in TimescaleDB-specific operations. Previously, the library assumed all TimescaleDB objects would be created in the default schema.

This enhancement allows developers to:

- Create hypertables in custom schemas
- Configure continuous aggregates across different schemas
- Apply reorder policies to hypertables in non-default schemas
- Properly scaffold databases that use multiple schemas

The migration generator now correctly handles schema qualifications in all generated SQL statements, ensuring that TimescaleDB functions operate on the correct schema-qualified table names.

## Dependencies

This release maintains compatibility with Entity Framework Core and PostgreSQL provider dependencies from previous versions.
