# Version 0.3.0

**Release Date:** November 7, 2025

This major release introduces comprehensive support for TimescaleDB continuous aggregates, enabling both code-first and database-first development workflows.

---

## New Features

### Continuous Aggregates Support

Added support for TimescaleDB continuous aggregates, allowing developers to define materialized views that automatically refresh and pre-compute aggregate data for time-series queries.

Continuous aggregates can be configured using either data annotations or the fluent API, and support common aggregate functions including:

- `Sum` - Calculate totals across time buckets
- `Avg` - Compute averages for time periods
- `Min` / `Max` - Find minimum and maximum values
- `Count` - Count occurrences
- `First` / `Last` - Retrieve first or last values in time buckets

**Code-First Configuration:**

Configure continuous aggregates directly in the Entity Framework Core model using the fluent API or data annotations. The migration system generates the appropriate SQL to create and manage the materialized views.

**Database-First Scaffolding:**

When scaffolding an existing TimescaleDB database, the design-time tools now recognize continuous aggregates and generate the corresponding entity configurations automatically. This enables seamless reverse engineering of databases that already use continuous aggregates.

This feature significantly enhances the library's capabilities for building high-performance time-series applications that require pre-aggregated data.

## Bug Fixes

### Schema Filtering

Resolved an issue related to schema filtering when working with continuous aggregates across multiple database schemas. The scaffolding process now correctly handles schema-qualified object names.

### Aggregate Function Enum

Fixed a typo in the aggregate function enumeration where `Count` was incorrectly spelled as `Cout`.

## Improvements

### Cleaner Scaffolding Architecture

Implemented a cleaner architecture for the database-first scaffolding system, improving code organization and maintainability for continuous aggregate support. This refactoring provides a better foundation for future enhancements.

---

## Dependencies

This release maintains compatibility with Entity Framework Core and PostgreSQL provider dependencies from previous versions.
